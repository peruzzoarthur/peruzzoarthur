## About Me

Hello there 👋

My name is Arthur, and I'm a former Environmental Engineer with an emphasis on data analysis and Geographic information system (GIS) technologies, currently transitioning into the field of software development.

I began my journey in software development approximately two years ago. Since then, I've been working hard on building the skills needed to become a proficient fullstack web developer.

### 💻️ Technologies I Use

- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, @tanstack-router, @tanstack-query, tailwindcss

- **Backend:** Typescript, Nest.js

- **Database:** PostgreSQL and PostGIS

- **Scripting:** Python (mostly for data processing and GIS data analysis)

- **Cloud:** AWS Services and Terraform (IAC)

### 👁️‍🗨️ Current Focus

Recently, I've been been building a React Web GIS front-end for map creating and viewing. Check the project [here](https://cgis.up.railway.app/).

## 🚀 Portfolio Project

My portfolio is now a fullstack application! With a back-end for handling a series of posts I'm starting, with the intent of sharing my path and knowledge.
