## About Me
Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Arthur, and I'm a former Environmental Engineer with an emphasis on data analysis and GIS technologies, currently transitioning into the field of software development.

I began my journey in software development approximately two years ago. Since then, I've been working hard on building the skills needed to become a proficient fullstack web developer.

### Technologies I Use

- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React.js, @tanstack-router, @tanstack-query, TailwindCSS, Shadcn.ui
- **Backend:** Nest.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL and PostGIS
- **Scripting:** Python (mostly for data processing and GIS data analysis)
- **Cloud:** AWS Services and Terraform (IAC)

### Current Focus

Recently, I've been been building a React Web GIS front-end for map creating and viewing. Check the project [**here**](https://cgis.up.railway.app/).


## Portfolio Project

My portfolio is now a fullstack application with a back-end for handling a series of posts I'm starting with the intent of sharing my path and knowledge!
